Project developed for the study presented in the article "A Convolutional Neural Network model for stress classification based on electrocardiogram data".
<br><br>
This study proposes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying levels and types of stress using electrocardiogram data. The model was trained on data from the Non-EEG dataset. This dataset has records of heart rate measurements of 20 individuals who were monitored while performing certain stress-inducing activities. The individuals performed activities that induce physical, cognitive and emotional stress. The CNN model achieved an accuracy rate of 97.50 % in predicting types of stress.

Additionally, other Machine Learning models were trained with the Non-EEG dataset to verify the hypothesis that the performance of the CNN model could outperform such models. The other models trained were: K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and Multilayer Perceptron.

The libraries used in the project were: Tensorflow, Keras, scikit-learn, Pandas, Imbalanced-learn, Matplotlib and Python waveform-database (WFDB).
